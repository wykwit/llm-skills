# llm-skills

LLM [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) consumed by multiple LLM harnesses: **omp**, **opencode**, **openclaw**, **hermes**, etc.

## Install

```sh
make install    # or: ./tools/install.sh
```

Idempotent; re-run after every `git pull`. It:

1. lints every skill (aborts on problems),
2. symlinks `skills/<name>` into the shared hub `~/.agents/skills`, pruning links for removed skills,
3. wires harnesses that don't read the hub natively (hermes: adds the hub to `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`).

omp, opencode and openclaw read `~/.agents/skills` on their own.

Override the hub with `SKILLS_HUB=/path ./tools/install.sh`.

Other targets: `make uninstall`, `make lint`, `make link` (link + prune without full install).

| `pr-summary` | Writing a PR summary/description for the current branch |
| `quick-code-review` | Fast read-only review of uncommitted working-tree changes |
